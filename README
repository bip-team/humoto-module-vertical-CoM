This is a demo of compiling external modules for Humoto, i.e., modules which
are not stored in the main repository of Humoto.

Directory layout:
    humoto          -- a submodule which links the main repository of Humoto;
    extra_modules   -- a folder with extra modules for Humoto containing a
                       single mock example;
    Makefile        -- compilation script for the example module.

The example module is compiled with 'make all' command. You can learn the
necessary cmake parameters for Humoto compilation scripts by reading Makefile.

You can use this repository as a template for new Humoto modules -- for this
purpose you have to replace the mock module 'extra_modules/example' with your
code.
